By 2050 an estimated 4.8 billion people will be affected by water scarcity. As current water supplies become increasingly strained, other methods of water collection will be required. 1.3 trillion litres of water currently exist in the atmosphere, a currently untapped resource. Thermo-responsive polymers, such as Poly-NIPAM, can absorb water from the air. The water can be regenerated by heating the material up. Theoretically, this material could be incorporated into a product to provide drinking water from the air.
