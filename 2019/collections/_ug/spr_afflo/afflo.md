Afflo is an AI-enabled wearable monitor to track and record asthmatic symptoms and triggers. Respiratory audio signals are collected through a microphone mounted on the patients chest in the Afflo Wearable. Environmental information is collected through a sensor bundle, the Afflo
Pod. These two streams of data are analysed using Artificial Intelligence to make predictions about each patientâ€™s personal triggers. This is presented back to the user through the Afflo Mobile Application, allowing them to make decisions to minimise their asthmatic symptoms. This end-to-end system takes the guesswork out of trigger diagnosis.
