Competition horses are expected to push themselves beyond their limit with every performance. However, even the most experienced riders and horse handlers sometimes struggle to identify subtle changes in the horseâ€™s stress levels.

Cavamo is a non-invasive equine stress sensor. The sensor analyses spontaneous blink rate to determine stress levels and to validate the effectiveness and suitability of equestrian training exercises. The stress levels are indicated to the rider in real-time with LEDs as well as being sent to the Cavamo app for further analysis and logbooking.
