The Dyson School of Design Engineering is housed in the newly refurbished Edwardian Baroque former South Kensington Post Office. Exhibitions of cutting edge innovation will include projects from our graduating MEng students, those from the double masters with the RCA in Global Innovation Design and Innovation Design Engineering. We will also be showcasing design engineering research.

## Exhibitors

### MA/MSC Global Innovation Design

GID is a multidisciplinary, transnational Programme and graduates are awarded both an MA from the Royal College of Art (RCA) and an MSc from Imperial College London (ICL). Over the two years, each student will spend two terms overseas at two of our global partners - either at Keio University in Tokyo, followed by Pratt Institute in New York, or at Tsinghua University in Beijing, followed by Nanyang Technical University in Singapore. Immersed in a mix of global cultures, our graduates become experts in observation, operation and synthesis of cultural insights - amassing a rich mix of perspectives on design, engineering, business and culture. 

### MA/MSC Innovation Design Engineering

Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) is a unique double Masterâ€™s Programme that has been run jointly with Imperial College London for over 38 years. It is a leading-edge, interdisciplinary course that focuses on the exploration and development of impactful innovation through critical observation, disruptive design thinking, experimentation, exploration of emergent technologies, advanced engineering and enterprise activities.

### MEng Design Engineering at the Dyson School

Design engineers are problem solvers who bridge the gap between traditional engineering and design. It's a discipline which draws on knowledge of manufacturing techniques, product development, technical design and rapid prototyping to bring new innovations to market. It also focuses on improving existing products and the processes used for making them.
This course, run within the Dyson school at Imperial College London, aims to develop a range of fundamental design and engineering skills, with a particular emphasis on creativity, computer-aided engineering tools, optimisation, human factors, design process, and the enterprise skills and industrial experience necessary to launch brand new products to market.
