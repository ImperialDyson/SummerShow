The Robotics and Biomechanics theme is engaged with fundamental research in the design and analysis of robotic and biomechanical systems. We aim to build understanding of how physical mechanisms in robots and animals contribute to solving hard control problems. We build advanced machine learning algorithms for enhancing the cognitive and physical abilities of autonomous robots. We study and develop novel robot technology to better support humans while operating intelligently in the real world under extreme diversity and uncertainty. Some of our research areas include:

Robot design, sensing, actuation, and control

Machine learning for advancing the robot intelligence

Designing new technology for gross and fine manipulation

Understanding the effects of mechanical forces on the human body

Building devices that enhance the human body and its interaction with robotic systems
