The Energy Technologies and Systems theme within the Dyson School of Design Engineering has a multi-disciplinary research focus on the generation, storage, transmission and usage of different energy vectors such as electrical and thermal. This work spans several length scales of interest from materials synthesis and characterisation, and device level performance modelling to whole system analysis and includes:

* The design of electrochemical devices from atom to systems for technologies such as batteries, fuel cells and solar cells

* Electrical energy transmission, monitoring and harvesting

* Combined solar-thermal energy technologies

* Gas turbine and turbomachinery technologies

* Energy systems design
