As global manufacturing systems move towards Industry 4.0 it is vital that we are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to harness its full potential. The Manufacturing theme is doing this through developing advanced CAE, innovative material processing and digital manufacturing processes. The theme covers a broad range of length scales from material synthesis and characterisation, to manufacturing technology development, and system implementation. Currently, the main active research areas are:

* Low carbon transport facilitated by lightweight structural design
* Innovative material processing technologies
* Design for additive manufacture
* Development of bio-printing technologies
