The Audio Experience Design theme includes researchers and projects in areas related with both the physical and the perceptual natures of audio, with particular focus on sonic interaction and user experience. Currently, the main active research areas are:

* Spatial hearing and binaural audio

* Wearable embedded interactive audio systems

* Audiology and hearing devices

We put particular attention towards applications and the impact of our research, aiming at both developing novel technologies and techniques, and at using them to improve the quality of life for end users through how they experience audio interfaces. In order to fulfill these aims, we work closely with several companies and institutions, from hearing aid manufacturers to artistic production companies, from hospitals to national and international research centres.
